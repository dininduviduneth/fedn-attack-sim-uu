FEDn Poisoning Attack Simulator
===============================

This project was conducted as a component for my master's thesis in the completion of my master's degree in Data Science - Data Engineering track.

The project was to build a poisoning attack simulator for federated learning scenarios for the users to assess the vulnerability of their models to poisoning attacks they define. It was developed on top of the opensource federated learning framework [FEDn](https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn). We implemented the simulator in a way such that a user can add their own implementation of an attack into the framework and run scenarios as simulations.

This repository was forked from the original [FEDn repository](https://github.com/scaleoutsystems/fedn) and the parallel documentation of the forked repository can be found here [LINK].
